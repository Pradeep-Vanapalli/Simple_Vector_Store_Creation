Vector Database

* Vector is basically list of components with some dimensionality.	
* Each Component has specific magnitude and direction(Axis and Dimension)

Types of Vectors:
	1. Dense
		* Most Common Types
		* Non Zero Values ===> [1, -2, 4]
		* Holds some amount of information
	2. Sparse
		* Zero component or elements
		* Used when the data has lot of dimensions having empty or negligible values
		* Common for word embeddings ===> [1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Steps to create a vector store:
	1. FAISS
	2. Chroma DB

	Applications:
		* Machine Learning 
		* NLP
		* Recommendation Engine

	Steps:
		* Programming Language ==> C, C++, Java, Python
		* Data Structure ==> In Memory(our target),
							 Important for efficiency
		* Storage Format ==> Storing the vectors in memory
							 Arrays, List, Custom Data Structure
		* Loading the vector 
		* Indexing ==> Search faster, For efficient retrieval of vector
			Techniques:
				1. Creating Hash Maps
				2. Data Structures like KD-Trees, Ball Trees..etc for speeding up the retrieval process
		* Querying ==> Implement methods or fuctions
				1. Similarity
				2. Range
				3, Specific Identifiers
		* Update Vectors ==> Add, Modify, Delete
		* Memory Management 
		* Serialization and Persistance
			* Persist the vector store  to the disk
			* Implement serialize and de-serialize to save and load the vector store
		* Testing and Optimization
		* Documentation 
		* Scaling
			* Distributed Computing
			* Sca;ing techniques
